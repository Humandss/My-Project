A typical system(code) used the link above such as enemy class, bullets class, players class , explosion class.

We tried to give a difference and increase the fun of the game by giving players and enemies more attributes (such as attack power, speed, physical strength, points, etc.), 
and tried to change the overall UI or graphic resources to match our game. And by implementing store systems and coins, players tried to provide more diversity in play.

difference ) overall UI systems, graphic resources, composition of games, addition of the enemy and the player's attributes, store and coin systems, 
               level design, various playable planes, sound effecct, controll key.
